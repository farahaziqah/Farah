    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I was given name Farah Haziqah by parents. I was born on June 14, 2003, and grew up in Muar, Johor.
        I am 21 years old right now. My family is humble and we live in a neighborhood. 
        I truly am a native of the state of Johor. 
        I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Parit Jawa, Muar, and Sekolah Agama Parit Jawa for my basic education. 
        I took four exams in elementary school: the UPKK, UPSR, SDEA, and SDKA (Special Class). Students from Johor state schools are the only ones who can take SDEA and SDKA. 
        For Johorians, the Special Class (SDKA) is a privilege. I subsequently pursued my education at SMA Assaiyidah Aisyah, Serkam Melaka, from Form 1 to Form 3. 
        I completed the Form 3 Assessment (PT3) test during Form 3. I then moved to SMK Pekan Baru in Muar, Johor, where I sat for the Malaysian Certificate of Education (SPM) test. 
        Lastly, I resumed my education in SMK Raja Muda in Muar, Johor, in Form 6. I have found that attending different schools has allowed me to learn a lot and become accustomed to the customs of each state. This has been the most interesting experience for me. </p>
